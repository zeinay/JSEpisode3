# JavaScript Episode 2

In this exercise your objective will be to write the following functions:

* `logger(array)`:
    * takes an array
    * logs every element from that array to the console
    * should use `forEach`


* `toCelsius(temperaturesInFahrenheit)`:
    * takes an array of temperatures in Fahrenheit
    * returns an array of those temperatures converted to Celsius
    * should use `map`


* `hottestDays(temperatures, threshhold)`:
    * takes an array of temperatures
    * takes a threshhold
    * returns an array with every temperature above the threshhold
    * should use `filter`


* `logHottestDays(temperaturesInFahrenheit, threshhold)`:
    * takes an array of temperatures in Fahrenheit
    * takes a threshhold
    * logs only temperatures that exceed the threshold from that array to the console
    * logs temperatures in Celsius.

## Instructions

#### Tools

* Install `node`:
  ```bash
  $ brew install node
  ```
* Install `yarn`:
  ```bash
  $ brew install yarn --without-node
  ```

#### The Files

**Fork** this repository and clone your fork (make sure you clone it into your `development` directory):

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/<your_username>/JSEpisode2.git
```

Inside you'll find two `.js` files:

* `iterators.js` - this is the file you'll be editing
* `iterators.spec.js` - this is a testing file. It checks that your functions have the features discussed above.   
  **DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE**

#### Running The Tests

Install all the requirements:

  1. Navigate to the project root (you'll find a file called `package.json` there).
  2. Install the requirments using `yarn install`.

Run the tests:

```bash
$ yarn test
```

This command will run the testing file and test your `pairs()` function to make sure it has all the required features.  

You'll know when you're done when your code passes all the tests.
